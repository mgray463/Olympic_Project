# Olympic_Project
My personal project analyzing the correlation between a country's GDP per capita and it's success in the Olympics.


In this project, I conducted an analysis using economic data from the World Bank and Olympic data gathered from Kaggle to 
attempt to find a correlation between GDP per capita and Olympic medal count. By following the steps in Python listed below, I was 
able to find that there was very little relationship between the two variables:

-Exploratory Analysis

-Linear Regression Model

-Cluster Analysis

-Time-Series Analysis
